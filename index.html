          <h2>Women in STEM empowerment</h2>
          <p>This project was an initiative to mentor students and society as a whole to advocate for gender equality and that technology is used to improve industry,innovation and infrastructure. In a recent research,men take up around 72% of technology roles whereas women take up only 28%.This is because women are discouraged and not given enough voice to engage in STEM careers.Diversity is critical in tech as it enables creation of better and safer products that take everyone into consideration.Diversity will promote creativity,better performance hence innovations and industry will grow as technology grows by the day.In the August-December period, I plan to empower more women to take up STEM roles through mentorship and tech bootcamps for them to upskill. I will evaluate impact using surveys.  <br>
